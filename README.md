## Assembly

Assembly is quite easy. Below are the steps to follow. The only required tools are a screwdriver and small pliers.

### Step 1

Install 3 binding posts. These provide connections to the keyer. Each post requires:

* M3 Bolt 16mm * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 1
* Printed Binding Post * 1
* M3 Knurled Thumb Nut * 1
* M3 Nut * 1
* M3 Washer * 1

Expect to bury the nut within the body of the binding post. See the images below for the detailed construction. 

<img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/G0PJO-Mag-1/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S1F1.JPG" width="100"> <img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/G0PJO-Mag-1/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S1F2.JPG" width="300"> <img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/G0PJO-Mag-1/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S1F3.JPG" width="300">

### Step 2

Build the two arms. Each arm requires:

* Arm * 1
* Lever Plate * 1
* M2 Bolt 6mm * 1
* M2 Nut 
* M3 Bolt 6mm * 2
* M3 Nut * 2
* M3 Solder Tag * 1
* Neodymium Magnet * 1

Expect to bury the nuts within the arms. If you have a problem inserting the nuts into the arm then simply 
use a longer bolt to pull them in to the arm. See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 3

Assemble the two magnet attraction bolts. Each bolt requires:

* M3 Knurled Bolt 20mm * 1
* M3 Knurled Nut * 2
* M3 Nut * 2

See the images below for the detailed construction. 

<img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/G0PJO-Mag-1/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S3F1.JPG" width="300"> <img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/G0PJO-Mag-1/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S3F2.JPG" width="300"> <img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/G0PJO-Mag-1/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S3F3.JPG" width="300"> 

### Step 4

Assemble the two signal contacts and attach the frame to the base place. Each side requires:

* M3 Bolt 16mm * 2
* M3 Nut * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 2

The M3 bolt goes through an M3 solder tag, through the base plate into the body, 
though an M3 solder tag and then through the M3 bolt.
See the images below for the detailed construction. 

<img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/G0PJO-Mag-1/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S4F1.JPG" width="300"> <img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/G0PJO-Mag-1/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S4F2.JPG" width="300"> <img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/G0PJO-Mag-1/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S4F3.JPG" width="300"> 

### Step 5

Assemble the DIT and DAH short contact posts. Each post requires:

* M3 Knurled Bolt 20mm * 1
* M3 Knulred Nut * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 2
* M3 Nut * 2
* M3 Bolt 16mm * 1
* Printed Short Contact Post * 2

Starting at the top put the knurled nut onto the knurled bolt and screw it all the way down. 
Pass the bolt thought the 3mm hole in the side of the contact post and put one M3 solder 
tag and 3mm nut on the other size and screw home so that the nut is pulled into the contact 
post. At the bottom push the hoop end of a 3mm solder tag into the contact post and above 
that push in a M3 nut. Screw the M3 bolt up through the bottom until it has passed through
the nut. You should then be able to bend the bottom 3mm solder tag over the M3 nut so that 
it makes contact with the upper M3 solder tag. The solder tag can then be soldered together. 
This can be done in situ, but it is best to disassemble and solder them separately.
See the images below for the detailed construction.

<img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/G0PJO-Mag-1/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S5F3.jpg" width="300">


### Step 2

Install 2 binding posts. These proveide connections to the DIT and DAH contacts. Each post requires:

* M3 Bolt 16mm * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 2
* Printed Binding Post * 1
* M3 Nut * 2
* M3 Washer * 1

These are constructed in the same way as the binding posts in step 1 apart from there being an extra solder tag on the top side
of the board. See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 3

Install the knob and knob plate on the yoke. This requires:

* M2 Bolt 6mm * 1
* M2 Nut * 1
* M3 Bolt 12mm * 1
* M3 Nut * 1
* Printed Yoke * 1

Start by bolting the knob plate to the yoke using the M2 nut and bolt. The M2 nut should be buried in the yoke itself. 
Insert the M3 nut into the slot in the side of the knob and temporarily insert the M3 bolt in the bottom and screw home. 
This simply ensures that the nut is correctly positioned, remove the bolt. Push the M3 bolt through the knob plate, through
yoke, and into the knob. Position it so that the slot in the knob is pointing downwards and out of sight.
See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 4

Install the DIT contact in the lever arm. This requires:

* M3 Bolt 6mm * 1
* M3 Nut * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 1

Simply insert the bolt through the solder tab and then through the lever arm. The nut is buried in the lever arm itself.
See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 5

Assemble the DAH tension sprint. This requires:

* M3 Bolt 25mm * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 1
* M3 Nut * 1
* M3 Nylon Washer * 1
* Compression Spring 7mm x 10mm * 1
* Assembled Lever Arm * 1
* Printed Dah Sprint Cup * 1
* M3 Knurled Nut * 2

Start by putting the solder tag on the M3 bolt, add the M3 nut and tightened all the way. Hold the lever arm on its side and
place the nylon washer between the yoke and the lever arm so that it aligns with the 3mm hole. Push the bolt through the
hole in the yoke, through the nylon washer and through the lever arm. Place the spring over the bolt followed by the
DAH sprint cup so that it holds the spring secure. Add the two remaining M3 knurled nuts. See the images below for the 
detailed construction.

### Step 6

Assemble the DIT and DAH short contact posts. Each post requires:

* M3 Knurled Bolt 20mm * 1
* M3 Knulred Nut * 1
* M3 Solder Tag * 2
* M3 Nut * 2
* M3 Bolt 16mm * 1
* Printed Short Contact Post * 2

Starting at the top put the knurled nut onto the knurled bolt and screw it all the way down. 
Pass the bolt thought the 3mm hole in the side of the contact post and put one M3 solder 
tag and 3mm nut on the other size and screw home so that the nut is pulled into the contact 
post. At the bottom push the hoop end of a 3mm solder tag into the contact post and above 
that push in a M3 nut. Screw the M3 bolt up through the bottom until it has passed through
the nut. You should then be able to bend the bottom 3mm solder tag over the M3 nut so that 
it makes contact with the upper M3 solder tag. The solder tag can then be soldered together. 
This can be done in situ, but it is best to disassemble and solder them separately.
See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 7

Assemble the DIT rest. This requires:

* M3 Knurled Bolt 20mm * 1
* M3 Knulred Nut * 1
* Printed Main Frame * 1

Put the 3mm knurled nut on to the 3mm knurled bolt and screw it halfway down. Push the end of the 
3mm bolt through the right-hand arm of the body and add the 3mm nut. Screw this home until the nut is
pulled into the arm. See the images below for the detailed construction.

<img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/SEMI-AUTOMATIC-BUG-key---From-the-ground-up/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S7F1.jpg" width="300"> <img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/SEMI-AUTOMATIC-BUG-key---From-the-ground-up/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S7F2.jpg" width="200">

### Step 8

Assemble the DIT tension. This requires:

* M3 Knurled Bolt 20mm * 1
* M3 Knurled Nut * 1
* M3 Nut * 3
* Printed Spring Cup * 1
* Printed Main Frame * 1

Put the M3 knurled nut on to the M3 knurled bolt and screw it all the way down. Push the end of the 
3mm bolt through the left-hand arm of the body. Add two further M3 nuts, the sprint cup with the 
opening facing to the right, and a further M3 nut. The last two M3 nuts need to be adjusted to hold
the print cup tight at the end of the M3 knurled bolt. The inner M3 nut needs to be pulled into the
arm screwing home the bolt. See the images below for the detailed construction.

### Step 9

Secure the assembled lever arm into the body. This requires:

* Assembled lever arm * 1
* M2 Bolt 20mm * 2
* M2 Nut * 2
* Compression Spring 7mm x 10mm * 1
* Printed Main Frame * 1

Start by putting 1 M2 bolt though the top and screwing on a nut so that the thread just pokes though. Repeat this process for the
bottom. Push the assembled lever arm through the main frame until holes in the upright align with the M2 bolts. Screw the M2 bolts
home. This can be fiddly and best done holding the main frame horizontal. Put one end of the compression spring in the spring cup 
and the other end in the recess in the lever arm. You may need to adjust the DIT rest to hold the sprint in place. See the images 
below for the detailed construction.

<img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/SEMI-AUTOMATIC-BUG-key---From-the-ground-up/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S9F1.jpg" width="300"> <img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/SEMI-AUTOMATIC-BUG-key---From-the-ground-up/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S9F2.jpg" width="300">  <img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/SEMI-AUTOMATIC-BUG-key---From-the-ground-up/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S9F3.jpg" width="300"> <img src="https://github.com/MartinDavidWaller/SEMI-AUTOMATIC-BUG-key---From-the-ground-up/blob/master/Pictures/Assembly/S9F4.jpg" width="300"> 

### Step 10

Secure the main frame to the base. This requires:

* M3 Bolt 16mm * 2
* M3 Nut * 2
* Assembled Base * 1
* Assembled Main Frame * 1

Insert the two M3 bolts up through the base and into the main frame. Add the M3 nuts and secure. See the images 
below for the detailed construction.

### Step 11

Secure the DIT and DAH contact posts to the base. This requires:

* M3 Solder Tag * 2
* Assembled Short Contact Post * 2
* Assembled Base * 1

Insert one M3 bolt through an M3 solder tag and then up through the base. Screw into the bottom of a sort contact post. 
Align the contact post with the associated DIT or DAH contact. Repeat for the second short contact post. See the images 
below for the detailed construction.

### Step 12

Add hook up wires. This requires:

* Assembled keyer * 1
* Short lengths of hook up wire, preferably multi strand for the top connections.

This is best described by the images below.
